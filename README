NAME
    "Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia" - Creates corpora for summarization
    testing.

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      $corpus->create;
      dump $corpus->getListOfXmlFiles;

DESCRIPTION
    "Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia" creates corpora for summarization
    testing using the featured articles of various Wikipedias.

    A criterion for an article in a Wikipedia to be *featured* is that it
    have a well written lead section, or introduction; thus, the featured
    articles of a Wikipedia can make an excellent corpus for testing single
    document summarization methods. This module creates a corpus from the
    featured articles of a Wikipedia by fetching and saving their content as
    HTML, text, and XML, with the appropriate sections labeled as either
    "summary" or "body".

CONSTRUCTOR
  "new"
    The constructor "new" creates an instance of the
    "Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia" class with the following
    parameters:

    "languageCode"
         languageCode => 'en'

        "languageCode" is the language code of the Wikipedia from which the
        corpus of featured articles are to be created. The supported
        language codes are "af":Afrikaans, "ar":Arabic, "bg":Bulgarian,
        "ca":Catalan, "cs":Czech, "de":German, "el":Greek, "en":English,
        "eo":Esperanto, "es":Spanish, "eu":Basque, "fa":Persian,
        "fi":Finnish, "fr":French, "he":Hebrew, "hr":Croatian,
        "hu":Hungarian, "id":Indonesian, "it":Italian, "ja":Japanese,
        "ka":Georgian, "ko":Korean, "ml":Malayalam, "mr":Marathi,
        "ms":Malay, "nl":Dutch, "nn":Norwegian, "no":Norwegian, "pl":Polish,
        "pt":Portuguese, "ro":Romanian, "ru":Russian, "sh":Serbocroatian,
        "sk":Slovak, "sl":Slovenian, "sr":Serbian, "sv":Swedish, "th":Thai,
        "tr":Turkish, "vi":Vietnamese, and "zh":Chinese. The default is
        "en".

    "corpusDirectory"
         corpusDirectory => 'cwd'

        "corpusDirectory" is the corpus directory that the summaries and
        articles will be stored in; the directory is created if it does not
        exist. The default is the "cwd".

        A language subdirectory is created at "corpusDirectory/languageCode"
        that will contain the directories "log", "html", "unparsable",
        "text", and "xml". The directory "log" will contain the file
        "log.txt" that all errors, warnings, and informational messages are
        logged to using Log::Log4perl. The directory "html" will contain
        copies of the HTML versions of the featured article pages fetched
        using LWP. The directory "text" will contain two files for each
        article; one file will end with "_body.txt" and contain the body
        text of the article, the other will end with "_summary.txt" and will
        contain the summary. The directory "unparsable" will contain the
        HTML files that could not be parsed into *body* and *summary*
        sections. All files are UTF-8 encoded.

METHODS
  "create"
    The method "create" fetches the featured articles and creates the text
    and XML versions of the files.

      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      $corpus->create;
      dump $corpus->getListOfXmlFiles;
      dump $corpus->getListOfTextFiles;

    "maxProcesses"
         maxProcesses => 1

        "maxProcesses" is the maximum number of processes that can be
        running simultaneously to parse the files. Parsing the files for the
        summary and body sections may be computational intensive so the
        module Forks::Super is used for parallelization. The default is one.

    "test"
         test => 0

        If "test" is a positive integer than it will be treated as the
        maximum number of pages that may be fetched and parsed. The default
        is zero, meaning all possible pages are fetched and parsed.

  "recreate"
    The method "recreate" recreates the text and XML versions of the files
    from the list of previously fetched HTML files in the "html" directory.

      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      $corpus->recreate;
      dump $corpus->getListOfXmlFiles;
      dump $corpus->getListOfTextFiles;

    "maxProcesses"
         maxProcesses => 1

        "maxProcesses" is the maximum number of processes that can be
        running simultaneously to parse the files. Parsing the files for the
        summary and body sections may be computational intensive so the
        module Forks::Super is used for parallelization. The default is one.

    "test"
         test => 0

        If "test" is a positive integer than it will be treated as the
        maximum number of pages that may be parsed. The default is zero,
        meaning all possible pages are parsed.

  "getListOfTextFiles"
    The method "getListOfTextFiles" returns an array reference with each
    item in the list having the form "{body => 'path_to_body_file', summary
    => 'path_to_summary_file'}".

      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      $corpus->create;
      dump $corpus->getListOfTextFiles;

  "getListOfXmlFiles"
    The method "getListOfXmlFiles" returns an array reference containing the
    path to each XML file.

      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use XML::Simple;
      use Data::Dump qw(dump);
      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      foreach my $xmlFile (@{$corpus->getListOfXmlFiles})
      {
        my $article;
        eval { $article = XMLin ($xmlFile) };
        if ($@) { dump \$@; } else { dump $article; }
      }

XML FORMAT
    The XML files are created using XML::Code with the simple structure
    outlined below:

      <document>
        <summary>
          <p>This is the first paragraph of the summary.</p>
          <p>This is the second paragraph of the summary.</p>
        </summary>
        <body>
          <section>
            <header>Head of first section</header>
            <p>First paragraph of this section.</p>
            <p>Second paragraph of this section.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>First paragraph of this section.</p>
            <p>Second paragraph of this section.</p>
            <section>
              <header>Head of  sub-section</header>
              <p>First paragraph of this sub-section.</p>
              <p>Second paragraph of this sub-section.</p>
            </section>
          </section>
        </body>
      </document>

EXAMPLE
    The following example computes and prints the median, mean, and standard
    deviation of the fraction of words (ignoring repeats) in a summary that
    also occur in the body of the text for all the articles in the corpora.

      use Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia;
      use Statistics::Descriptive;
      use File::Slurp;
      use Encode;

      my $corpus = Text::Corpus::Summaries::Wikipedia->new;
      my $statistics = Statistics::Descriptive::Full->new;
      foreach my $textFilePair (@{$corpus->getListOfTextFiles})
      {
        my $summary = lc decode ('utf8', read_file ($textFilePair->{summary}, binmode => ':raw'));
        my %summaryWords = map {($_, 1)} split (/\P{Letter}/, $summary);
        my $totalUniqueSummaryWords = keys %summaryWords;
        next unless $totalUniqueSummaryWords;

        my $body = lc decode ('utf8', read_file ($textFilePair->{body}, binmode => ':raw'));
        map {delete $summaryWords{$_}} split (/\P{Letter}/, $body);
        my $totalUniqueSummaryWordsNotInBody = keys %summaryWords;

        $statistics->add_data (1 - $totalUniqueSummaryWordsNotInBody / $totalUniqueSummaryWords);
      }

      print 'count: ', $statistics->count(), "\n";
      print 'median: ', $statistics->median(), "\n";
      print 'mean: ', $statistics->mean(), "\n";
      print 'standard deviation: ', $statistics->standard_deviation(), "\n";

    If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

BUGS
    This module creates corpora by parsing Wikipedia pages, the xpath
    expressions used to extract links and text will become invalid as the
    format of the various pages changes, causing some corpora not to be
    created.
